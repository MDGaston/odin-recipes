    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
      <li>3 cups chicken broth, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pork chop, diced</li>
      <li>2 zucchini, diced</li>
      <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
      <li>2 sprigs chopped fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>Â½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step1</h3>
    <p>
      Combine 2 cups of chicken broth and brown rice in a saucepan over medium
      heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer
      until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Step2</h3>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat and cook pork
      until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add zucchini and cook for 3
      minutes. Add 1 cup chicken broth and simmer until zucchini are soft, about
      5 minutes. Add rice. Mix in green onions, rosemary, and Parmesan cheese
      and cook until well combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
